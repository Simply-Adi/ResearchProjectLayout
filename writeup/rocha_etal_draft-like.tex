\section{Introduction}

Recent interest in upper-ocean dynamics has focused on the strong seasonal
cycle of shallow baroclinic instabilities and their role in submesoscale (roughly 1-100 km)
turbulence and mesoscale (roughly 100-300 km) modulation \citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014,
brannigan_etal2015,callies_etal2015, thompson_etal2016,buckingham_etal2016}. Contemporary studies
have also shown that inertia-gravity waves (IGWs) contribute significantly
to the near-surface variability at submesoscales \citep{richman_etal2012,
buhler_etal2014,rocha_etal2016}, but their seasonality has not been investigated.

% now SWOT
The partition between geostrophic and ageostrophic flows across
the submesoscales and their seasonality have immediate applications for the planning
of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission.
SWOT will deliver
sea-surface height (SSH) with about 15 km resolution, thereby providing the
first global SSH measurements at submesoscales \citep{fu_ubelmann2014}.
Thus, the projection of energetic submesoscale ageostrophic flows, such as
inertia-gravity waves (IGWs), onto SSH represents
a challenge and an opportunity for the SWOT community. The challenge: how to diagnose submesoscale
surface velocity from SSH. The opportunity: stimulation of research on interactions
between geostrophic and ageostrohic flows and their projection onto SSH.


Using the output of two comprehensive global numerical simulations, here we show
that IGWs undergo
a strong near-surface seasonal cycle in the Kuroshio Extension region.
Interestingly, the seasonal cycle of IGWs is out of phase
with the seasonal cycle of submesoscale turbulence. Consistent with previous studies,
submesoscale turbulence is strongest  in winter \citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014}.

IGWs with horizontal scales between 10-100 km (hereafter submesoscale IGWs),
however, peak in late summer/early fall,
when the upper ocean is strongly stratified. Thus there exists a
strong seasonal modulation of upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics:
submesoscale turbulence dominates the upper-ocean dynamics in late winter/early fall,
whereas submesoscale IGWs prevail in late summer/early fall.


\section{The LLC numerical simulations}
We use results of two latitude-longitude polar cap (LLC)
comprehensive numerical simulations. The outputs
analyzed here, LLC2160 (nominal resolution 1/24$^\circ$$\approx$4.7 km;
effective resolution $\approx$ 20 km) and LLC4320
(nominal resolution 1/48$^\circ$$\approx$2.3 km;
effective resolution $\approx$8 km),   are
forward solutions of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology general circulation model \citep[MITgcm; ][]{marshall_etal1997}
on a LLC grid  \citep{forget_etal2015} with
90 vertical levels. The coarser-resolution LLC simulation was
spun up from an Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II \citep[ECCO2; ][]{menemenlis_etal2008}
adjoint-method state estimate, constrained to millions
of observations from 2009 through 2011.

The LLC2160
output spans two years from March 2011 to April 2013; the LLC4320 was spun up from
the LLC2160 simulation, spanning one year from September 2011 to October 2012.
Both LLC2160 and LLC4320 simulations were forced by
tides hourly and by 6-hourly surface atmospheric fields.
The LLC4320 simulation is an extension of the 3-month long output used by
\citet{rocha_etal2016} --- for details, see supporting information.

Tidal forcing by the 16 most-significant components represents a key feature of the LLC2160 and
LLC4320 simulations. Barotropic tides flowing over topography convert significant tidal energy into the internal
wave field. Those internal waves project onto mesoscales to submesoscales
\citep[e.g., ][]{rocha_etal2016}. Hence tidal forcing fundamentally distinguishes our analysis
from other modeling studies of seasonality \citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014}.


To study seasonal variations in the upper-ocean dynamics, we focus on the northwest
Pacific, in the vicinity of the Kuroshio
Extension, where previous studies have shown strong mesoscale and submesoscale seasonality
\citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014}.
We analyze a sub-domain of the LLC4320 and LLC2160 simulations of about 2000 km$^2$
spanning 155-175$^\circ$E; 25-40$^\circ$N (Figure \ref{fig1}a). The stratification
in this mesoscale-rich subtropical region undergoes a vigorous seasonal cycle: wintertime-enhanced
small-scale turbulence de-stratifies the upper ocean, yielding mixed layers
deeper than 200 m to the north (Figure \ref{fig1}b). Summertime re-stratification yields mixed layers shallower
than 40 m (Figure \ref{fig1}c).

Fundamentally, the upper-ocean density structure is well-captured by both LLC simulations:
a comparison with Argo climatology \citep[updated from ][]{roemmich_gilson2009}  shows that both simulations skillfully represent the Kuroshio
Extension stratification and its seasonal variability  (supporting information). Moreover, model smoothed
fields have eddy kinetic energy (EKE) levels ($0.041$ m$^2$ s$^{-2}$) similar to Jason II across-track
geostrophic EKE ($0.036$ m$^2$ s$^{-2}$) and gridded geostrophic EKE ($0.032$ m$^2$ s$^{-2}$).



\section{Bulk statistics of the surface lateral velocity gradient tensor}
To study the seasonality in the surface velocity, we calculate the lateral velocity gradient tensor
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{matrix} u_x & u_y\\ v_x&v_y \end{matrix}\right]
\end{equation}
using a centered
second-order finite difference scheme --- we obtain qualitatively similar results
using spectral differentiation of velocity fields periodized with reflections;
statistics of fields obtained via spectral differentiation are 10-15$\%$ larger.
We then diagnose
the vertical vorticity
\begin{equation}
\zeta \equiv v_x - u_y\, ,
\end{equation}
lateral rate of strain
\begin{equation}
  \alpha \equiv [(u_x-v_y)^2 + (u_y + v_x)^2]^{1/2}\,,\\
\end{equation}
and horizontal divergence
\begin{equation}
\delta \equiv u_x + v_y\, .
\end{equation}
Because vortices, fronts, and IGWs are ubiquitous at submesoscales, second-order
statistics of vorticity, strain, and divergence highlight these
fine lateral scales \citep[e.g.,][]{shcherbina_etal2013}.

The model solutions depict seasonality in vorticity (Figures \ref{fig1}d-e): large values of
fine-grained vertical vorticity are observed in early spring with maximum
values as large as $4f$, where $f$ is
the local planetary vorticity, and root-mean-square (RMS) of about $0.4f$. In early
fall, the situation is the opposite: the vertical vorticity is relatively coarse-grained;
its local maximum and RMS are both smaller than $0.5f$.
Indeed, the vorticity and rate of strain are strongest in wintertime (Figure \ref{fig2}):
in both simulations, the RMS vorticity and strain rate are about twice as large in
late winter/early spring
than in late summer/early fall. Because the wintertime vorticity and strain rate
are dominated by the smallest scales in the flow (the KE spectrum is shallower than
a $-3$ power law in winter), increasing the resolution from
1/24$^\circ$ to 1/48$^\circ$ increases the wintertime RMS vorticity
and strain by about 40$\%$.

Subinertial flows account for the bulk of vertical vorticity and strain rate
($T_{32.5} = 2\pi/f_{32.5}\approx 22.3$h, where $f_{32.5}$ is the inertial frequency at
the  mid-latitude $32.5^\circ$N): daily-averaging the velocity fields suppresses super-inertial
motions and reduces the RMS
vorticity by 40$\%$ and the RMS strain by 10$\%$; the seasonal
cycle remains strong (see
dashed lines in figures \ref{fig2}a-b). Indeed, submesoscale flows account for
most of this seasonal cycle: smoothing the velocity fields
with a Hanning filter with cut off scale of 100 km dramatically reduces the RMS
vorticity and strain rate. The reduction in variance is about 80$\%$ in winter,
yielding RMS vorticity and strain  rate roughly consistent with the diagnostics from
AVISO gridded geostrophic velocities (compare red lines to black lines in figures \ref{fig2}a-b).
The picture that emerges is consistent with recent studies: shallow baroclinic
instabilities energize the submesoscales in winter, drawing from the available
potential energy stored in large lateral buoyancy gradients in deep mixed layers \citep{sasaki_etal2014,callies_etal2015,callies_etal2016}.

The seasonal cycle of the horizontal divergence, however, showcases the complexity
of the upper-ocean annual variability. If submesoscale turbulence dominated
the near-surface variability all year, then the seasonal cycle of horizontal divergence,
vertical vorticity, and lateral strain rate would be in phase \citep[e.g.,][]{sasaki_etal2014}.
While there is a clear wintertime peak in divergence of daily-averaged velocity
(see dashed lines in figure \ref{fig2}c; RMS divergence $\sim0.1 f$ in the 1/48$^\circ$
simulation), the hourly fields show
a stronger enhancement of
lateral divergence in late summer/early fall (RMS divergence $\sim0.22 f$ in the 1/48$^\circ$
simulation). Because the 1/48$^\circ$ simulation better resolves
smaller-scale submesoscale flows, a secondary RMS divergence peak in winter  is
nearly as strong as in summer. Submesoscale fronts and eddies evolve
relatively fast, and there is no clear
temporal and spatial scale separation between those motions and IGWs
\citep[][]{mcwilliams2016}:
daily-averaging the velocity fields efficiently suppresses the summertime horizontally
divergent flows, but also reduces the wintertime lateral divergence by about 50$\%$.
Figure \ref{fig2}c also shows that most of the lateral divergence is associated
with submesoscale flows: smoothing the velocity fields with a 100-km-cutoff
suppresses more than 80$\%$ of the RMS divergence.

\section{Joint probability density functions}

The results of figure \ref{fig2}a-c show that submesoscale surface
 variability stems from different dynamics in summer than in winter.
 To characterize these differences, we calculate
joint probability distributions (joint-PDF) of
vorticity-strain and vorticity-Laplacian of sea-surface height (Figure \ref{fig3}).

The April vorticity-strain joint-PDF has a shape characteristic of submesoscale turbulence
 (Figures \ref{fig3}a-b). The alignment of vorticity and strain $\alpha \sim \pm\zeta$
 with strong positive skewness are fingerprints of submesoscale fronts
 \citep{shcherbina_etal2013,mcwilliams2016}. The shape of the vorticity-strain
 joint-PDF is similar for hourly and daily-averaged fields, although
 the vorticity skewness reduces from 1.4 to 1.13 from hourly to daily-averaged.
 The April results indicate that wintertime submesoscale
 surface velocity is strongly dominated by submesoscale turbulence.
 The daily-averaged fields
 are largely in  geostrophic balance,
but the hourly velocity and sea-surface height fields have an important
ageostrophic component as depicted by the joint-PDF of vorticity-Laplacian of SSH
winter (Figure \ref{fig3}e).

The October vorticity-strain joint-PDF shows much weaker skewness (the vorticity skewness
is 0.68 and 0.67 for hourly and daily-averaged velocities). The shape of the
vorticity-strain joint-PDF  appears to be a combination of two half-ellipses centered
about $\zeta=0$, one with a 45$^\circ$ slope (characteristic of submesocale fronts
that persist in summer) and one with a very steep slope.
That the submesoscale dynamics in October are mainly ageostrophic is clearly depicted
in the shape of joint-PDF of vorticity-Laplacian of sea-surface height for hourly fields
 (Figure \ref{fig3}g), which is an ellipse aligned in the vertical axis.
Daily-averaging the model suppresses the ageostrophic, super-inertial flows, and, therefore,
the daily-averaged flow is essentially geostrophic as depicted by the 45$^\circ$-tilted
ellipse in the vorticity-Laplacian of sea-surface height joint-PDF (Figure \ref{fig3}h).

 Time series of PDFs of vorticity and divergence (supporting information) show
 a strong oscillation between these two regimes. In late winter/early spring
 the vorticity is strongly positively skewed, whereas the divergence is moderately
 negatively skewed (convergence/downwelling) as predicted by frontogenesis \citep[e.g., ][]{mcwilliams2016}.
 In late summer/early fall, the divergence is stronger, but PDFs are much less skewed,
consistent with a superposition of random linear IGWs \citep[e.g.,][]{garrett_munk1972}.

\section{Wavenumber-frequency spectrum}
To confirm that submesoscale IGWs account for most of the super-inertial SSH variance
and surface KE, we calculate the wavenumber-frequency spectrum of SSH variance. Focusing on
the high-frequency
content, we compute the wavenumber-frequency spectrum  every 10 days and average
the results to obtain a spectral estimate. Before calculating the discrete Fourier
transform, we
remove linear trends and multiply the data by a three-dimensional Hanning window.
We azimuthally-average the spectrum in wavenumber.


Mesoscales flows and the lunar semi-diurnal tide contain most of the
SSH variance (Figures \ref{fig4}a-b). But there is significant SSH variance at
submesoscales, both sub-inertial
and super-inertial. Sub-inertial SSH variance at submesoscales is larger in April, whereas
super-inertial SSH variance at submesoscales is larger in October. At scales smaller
than 100 km (submesoscales), the SSH variance is 66$\%$ larger in October than in April.
IGWs, particularly modes two through four, account for most of the SSH variance
increase in summer --- higher vertical
modes are more sensitive to changes in near-surface stratification (supporting information).
In October, super-inertial IGWs account for a SSH standard deviation of about 4.9 cm,
comparable to the April sub-inertial SSH standard deviation of $\sim$5.2 cm (Table \ref{tab1}).
Similarly, the submesoscale super-inertial surface KE is 63$\%$ larger in October
than in April (supporting information).

\end{table}

Figure \ref{fig4}c shows the integral over frequency
of wavenumber-frequency spectra in figures \ref{fig4}a-b.
Both in April and October, the
SSH wavenumber spectrum approximately follows a -2 power-law at submesoscales
(solid lines in figure \ref{fig4}c)  --- there is
small difference between the spectra owing to the phase cancellation between the
seasonal cycle of submesoscale turbulence and IGWs. The sub-inertial flow
has a steeper submesoscale SSH variance wavenumber spectrum (dashed lines in figure \ref{fig4}c).
 The difference between the SSH variance wavenumber spectrum for all frequencies and
 sub-inertial frequencies is dramatic in October when super-inertial flows account for
 about 80\% of the SSH variance and KE at submesoscales --- we obtain similar results by computing
SSH variance and KE wavenumber spectra directly from hourly and daily-averaged
SSH velocity fields.

\section{Discussion and conclusion}
Our work adds to recent model \citep[e.g., ][]{sasaki_etal2014}
and observational \citep[e.g., ][]{callies_etal2015,buckingham_etal2016} evidence of vigorous seasonality in
submesoscale turbulence. In particular ---
in global simulations with embedded tides --- near-surface submesoscale IGWs undergo
a strong seasonal cycle that is out of phase with the seasonal cycle of
submesoscale turbulence. IGW energy and SSH variance are significantly spread across
the submesoscales, likely through mesoscale advection and refraction, and
dispersion \citep[e.g.,][and references therein]{ponte_klein2015,alford_etal2016}
 and parametric
sub-harmonic instability \citep[PSI, e.g., ][]{mackinnon_winters2005}, though the
LLC simulations are unlikely to fully resolve PSI. In the LLC simulations,
super-inertial IGWs account for most of the surface submesoscale KE and SSH variance;
near-inertial IGWs project onto larger scales, possibly because submesoscale
NIWs quickly propagate into the interior and weakly project onto SSH.

 %We further conjecture that the summertime dominance of IGWs
 %\citep{callies_etal2015} is a consequence both of suppression of submesoscale turbulence and
%enhancement of IGWs due to re-stratification of
%the upper ocean.

\cite{dasaro1978} showed that the velocity of linear internal waves
in the mixed layer strongly depends on the density jump at the mixed layer
base, with largest velocities when the jump is strongest.
In summer, the shallow mixed layer overlays a strong seasonal pycnocline,
and thus the internal waves projection onto the mixed layer may be stronger
according to \cite{dasaro1978}'s arguments. An
alternative explanation is that the shape of the baroclinic modes
changes seasonally \citep[see World Ocean Atlas 2013,
][modal shapes in the supporting information]{levitus_etal2013}.


Internal tide energy flux does not show a seasonal modulation \citep[e.g.,][]{alford2003};
hence one expects a strong seasonality in the near-surface
expression of internal tides and
higher frequency IGWs if the near-surface stratification varies strongly.
The intermittent windy near-inertial wave (NIW) generation peaks in early winter, but
NIW energy has a similar energy level in October and April
\citep{alford_etal2016}. Furthermore, in our simulations the higher frequency inertia-gravity waves
account for most of the seasonality in super-inertial surface KE and SSH
(Figure \ref{fig4}a-b).

The seasonally varying mixed-layer depth challenges observation and simulation of
flows at mixed-layer deformation-radius length scale in observational programs and models with
fixed resolution \citep{buckingham_etal2016}. But the mixed layer available potential energy
is lowest in summer owing to shallow mixed-layer depths and weak lateral buoyancy
gradients \citep{callies_etal2015}. Moreover, in baroclinic turbulence, the deformation
radius has only a secondary, catalytic role --- most of the baroclinic conversion occurs at
larger scales \citep{larichev_held1995,callies_etal2016}.
Thus, the model failure to resolve the summertime
ML deformation radius is unlikely to account for the vigorous seasonality in submesoscale
turbulence.


In the context of SWOT, these results imply that if one is interested
only in the geostrophic flow, so that surface velocity can be diagnosed
from SSH, then the noise-to-signal ratio will have a strong seasonality owing
to the presence of IGWs (the coherent fraction of internal tides may be removed
efficiently).
An important caveat is that the Kuroshio Extension may be typical of a mesoscale-rich
subtropical regions, but it is unlikely to be
representative of other regions such as low-eddy-kinetic-energy eastern boundary
currents.  We plan to report on the geographic variability of submesoscale
seasonality in a future study.

The LLC output can be obtained from the ECCO project (\texttt{http://ecco2.org/llc$\_$hires}). The altimeter products were produced by Ssalto/Duacs
and distributed by AVISO, with support from CNES (\texttt{http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/duacs/}).
Codes and output files are available online at the project repository
 (\texttt{https://github.com/crocha700/UpperOceanSeasonality}).

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)

% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space

% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
