%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%
%Please use this template when formatting and submitting your Supporting Information.

%This template serves as both a “table of contents” for the supporting information for your article and as a summary of files.
%
%
%OVERVIEW
%
%Please note that all supporting information will be peer reviewed with your manuscript.
%In general, the purpose of the supporting information is to enable authors to provide and archive auxiliary information such as data %tables, method information, figures, video, or computer software, in digital formats so that other scientists can use it.
%The key criteria are that the data:
% 1. supplement the main scientific conclusions of the paper but are not essential to the conclusions (with the exception of
%    including %data so the experiment can be reproducible);
% 2. are likely to be usable or used by other scientists working in the field;
% 3. are described with sufficient precision that other scientists can understand them, and
% 4. are not exe files.
%
%USING THIS TEMPLATE
%
%***All references should be included in the reference list of the main paper so that they can be indexed, linked, and counted as citations.  The reference section does not count toward length limits.
%
%All Supporting text and figures should be included in this document. Insert supporting information content into each appropriate section of the template. %Figures and tables should appear above each caption.  To add additional captions, simply copy and paste each sample caption as needed.

%Tables may be included, but can also be uploaded separately, especially if they are larger than 1 page, or if necessary for retaining table formatting. Data sets, large tables, movie files, and audio files should be uploaded separately, following AGU naming conventions. Include their captions in this document and list the file name with the caption. You will be prompted to upload these files on the Upload Files tab during the submission process, using file type “Supporting Information (SI)”

\noindent\textbf{S1: Detail of the LLC simulations}

Table \ref{tab:llc} shows details of the LLC spin-up hierarchy.
Both simulations analyzed in the present paper, LLC2160 and LLC4320,
were forced by surface fluxes from the 0.14$^\circ$ European Centre for
Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) atmospheric operational model analysis,
 starting in 2011, and the 16 most significant  tidal components.
The LLC control files are available online
(at \texttt{http://mitgcm.org/viewvc/MITgcm/MITgcm$\_$contrib/
llc$\_$hires}).

For the LLC hierarchy, the sea-surface height is calculated
using a linearized equation. While the nominal horizontal resolution  of the
LLC4320 and LLC2160 simulations are 1/48$^\circ$ and 1/24$^\circ$, r
horizontal wavenumber spectra suggests an effective resolution of about 8 km and 20 km,
 respectively (see figure S1).

The spin-up of the upper-ocean in the LLC4320 (1/48$^\circ$) simulation is
a couple of days, as depicted the time series of surface horizontal divergence
in Figure 2b of the main text (see initial rapid increase in RMS divergence in
September 2011). To avoid the spin-up stage, we chose October to characterize the
late summer/early fall. The late winter/early spring waves chosen to be 6 months
out-of-phase with late summer/early fall (hence April).

\noindent\textbf{S5: How well do the LLC simulations capture high-frequency modes?}

To assess how well the LLC simulations represents the high-frequency variability,
we compare the model near-surface velocity field against two available
mooring data: KEO (the data is available online at \texttt{http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/ocs/KEO})
and KESS mooring $\#$7 (the data is available online at \texttt{http://uskess.whoi.edu}).
For proper comparison, we use model data closest to these two moorings (west of
the region considered in the present study). Focusing on high-frequencies, we
calculate frequency spectral estimates every month. There are about 48 independent
spectral realizations.

Figure \ref{figA1} shows KE frequency spectra for the LLC simulations and mooring data.
At the uppermost common depth (20 m), very low frequencies (periods $>$ 10 days)
and the inertial, diurnal, and semi-diurnal frequencies agree well --- the KESS
data are more energetic at intermediate frequencies. At 40 m, the LLC simulations and observations
have consistent spectra at periods larger than about 6 h. The data from the moorings
are more energetic at higher frequencies,
except for the first two harmonics that are apparent in the KESS data at 40 m.
There are at least three reasons for the slightly more energetic super-inertial
variability in the observations: 1) The high-
frequency variability is dominated by high-frequency noise due to mooring vertical
excursions; 2) The model does not have enough resolution to resolve the full internal
wave spectrum; 3) The model is not forced at frequencies higher than 6h.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% For tables and figures, add \usepackage{rotating} to the paper and add the rotating.sty file to the folder.
% AGU prefers the use of {sidewaystable} over {landscapetable} as it causes fewer problems.
