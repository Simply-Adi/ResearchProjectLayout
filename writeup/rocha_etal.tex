\section{Introduction}

Recent interest in upper-ocean dynamics has focused on the strong seasonal
cycle of shallow baroclinic instabilities and their role in submesoscale (1-100 km)
turbulence and mesoscale modulation \citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014,
callies_etal2015, thompson_etal2016,buckingham_etal2016}. Contemporary studies
have also suggested that inertia-gravity waves contribute significantly
to the near-surface variability at submesoscales \citep{richman_etal2012,
buhler_etal2014,rocha_etal2016}.

Using the output of two new primitive equation $1/24^\circ$ and $1/24^\circ$ global
 simulations with embedded tides, we show that the near-surface
expression of inertia-gravity waves undergoes a strong seasonal cycle that is out-of-phase
with the seasonal cycle of the balanced variability. This seasonal cycle is associated
with changes in the upper-ocean
stratification. Consistent with previous studies,
deep late Winter mixed-layers are prone to
shallow baroclinic instabilities that are roughly in geostrophic balance
and flux energy upscale \citep{sasaki_etal2014,callies_etal2016},
driving a mild seasonal modulation of the mesoscales \citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014}.
The horizontally divergent part of the flow, however, peaks in late Summer/early Fall,
when the upper-ocean is strongly stratified. Hence these results suggest a
strong seasonal modulation of the dominant upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics:
quasi-balanced turbulence in late Winter/early Spring and
quasi-linear inertia-gravity waves in late Summer/early Fall.

\section{The LLC numerical simulations}
We use the output of two latitude-longitude polar cap (LLC)
MITgcm realstic numerical simulations. The outputs
 analyzed here, LLC2160 and LLC4320,
are the 1/24$^\circ$ and 1/48$^\circ$  --- 90-vertical-levels simulations from
a hierarchy of global
forward numerical solutions on a LLC grid   \citep{forget_etal2015} that were
spun up from a ECCO2 adjoint-method state estimate. Both simulations were forced by
tides and 6-hourly surface fluxes. The LLC2160
output spans two years from March 2011 to April 2013; the LLC4320 was spun up from
the LLC2160 simulation, spanning one year from September 2011 to September 2012.
The LLC4320 simulation is an extension of the then 5-month long output used by
\citet{rocha_etal2016}.

A key aspect of the simulation analyzed here is that it is forced by
the 16 most significant tidal components.
Barotropic tides interact with topography and generate internal
tides that project on mesoscales to submesoscales
\citep{rocha_etal2016}. Tidal forcing fundamentally distinguishes our analysis
from recent modeling studies that investigated upper-ocean dynamics
and its seasonality \citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014}. The LLC2160 and LLC4320
simulations fully resolve internal tides and
other hydrostatic internal waves and other submesoscale processes at scales as
small as about 5 km.

To study seasonal variations in the upper-ocean dynamics, we focus on the northwest
Pacific, in the vicinities of the Kuroshio
Extension, where previous studies have suggested strong submesoscale seasonality.
We analyze a sub-domain of the LLC4320 and LLC2160 simulations of about 2000 km$^2$
spanning 155-175$^\circ$E; 25-40$^\circ$N (figure \ref{fig1}a). The stratification
in this mesoscale-rich subtropical region undergoes a strong seasonal cycle: wintertime
enhance small-scale turbulence de-stratify the upper ocean, yielding mixed-layers
as deep as 300m. In late Spring/early Summer enhanced solar radiation and mixed-layer
instabilities re-stratify the upper ocean, yielding mixed-layers as shallow as 40m.
The stratification and its seasonality is well-captured by both LLC simulations.
The excellent comparisons of model stratification to Argo climatology lends confidence
to the present analysis (supplemental material).


\section{Statistics of surface lateral velocity tensor}

We present estimates of bulk quantities
associated with the lateral velocity tensor
\begin{equation}
\nabla_h \bf{u}_h = \left[\begin{matrix} u_x & u_y\\ v_x&v_y \end{matrix}\right] \,.
\end{equation}
The components of the lateral velocity tensor are calculated using a centered
second-order finite differences scheme. We then calculate
the vertical vorticity $\zeta \equiv v_x - u_y$, lateral rate of strain
$\alpha \equiv [(u_x-v_y)^2 + (u_y + v_x)^2]^{1/2}$, and horizontal divergence $\delta \equiv u_x + v_y$.
These diagnostics highlight the submesoscale structures in the flow
and their analysis hint on the governing dynamics in the upper ocean
\citep{capet_etal2008a,shcherbina_etal2013}.

Figures \ref{fig1}b-c show snapshots of vertical vorticity $\zeta$ in early Spring
(April 15) and Fall (October 15) in the LLC4320 (1/48$^\circ$) simulation.
The model solutions captures theseasonality in vorticity
exists: large values of fine-grained vertical vorticity are
observed in early Spring with maximum values as high as $1.5f$, where $f$ is
the local planetary vorticity, and root-mean-square (RMS) of about 0.4. In early
Fall, the situation is the opposite: the vertical vorticity is relatively coarse-grained,
and its local maximum and RMS are no larger than $0.5f$ and $0.2f$, respectively.
Indeed, the seasonal cycle in vorticity is very strong (figure~\ref{fig2}):
in both simulations, the RMS vertical vorticity and lateral strain rate are about twice as large in
late Winter/early Spring
than it is in late Summer/early Fall. Because the wintertime vorticity and strain
are dominated by the smallest scales in the flow, increasing the resolution from
1/24$^\circ$ to 1/48$^\circ$ significantly increases the wintertime RMS vorticity
and strain by about 40$\%$.

The bulk of vertical vorticity and lateral strain rate is associated with subinertial flows
($T_f = 2\pi/f_0\approx 23.5$h, where $f_0$ is the inertial frequency at
the mean latitude): daily-averaging the velocity fields reduces the RMS
vorticity by less than 40$\%$ and the RMS strain by less than 10$\%$; the seasonal
cycle remains strong (see
dashed lines in figures \ref{fig2}a-b). Most of this seasonal cycle is associated
with submesoscale flows: smoothing the velocity fields
with a Hanning filter with cut-off scale of 100 km significantly reduces the RMS
vorticity and strain. The reduction in variance is dramatic ($>$80$\%$) in winter
yielding RMS vorticity and strain roughly consistent the ones diagnosed from
AVISO gridded geostrophic velocities (compare blue lines with black lines in figures \ref{fig2}a-b).
The overall picture that emerges is consistent with recent studies: shallow baroclinic
instabilities energize the submesoscales in late Winter, drawing from the available
potential energy stored in deep mixed layers \citep{sasaki_etal2014,callies_etal2015,callies_etal2016}.

The seasonal cycle of the horizontal divergent part of the flow, however, add complexity
to the submesoscale-turbulence-centred scenario depicted by those invertigators.


 is significant: the RMS is $\delta/f > 0.1$).
Most of these horizontal divergent flows are supra-inertial and project
on scales smaller than 100 km: daily-averaging or smoothing the velocity fields
 (100 km cutoff) reduces the horizontal divergence by about 70$\%$.
Interestingly, the seasonal cycle in horizontal divergence is out-of-phase with the
seasonal cycle of vertical vorticity: the horizontal divergence is about 30$\%$ larger in late
Summer/early Fall than it is in late Winter/early Spring. The divergence associated
with submesoscale subinertial eddies is small and its seasonal cycle is in phase
with that of vorticity (see green lines).  The seasonal cycle of the horizontal
divergence is roughly in phase with the seasonal cycle of the near-surface (0-50m)
stratification.

\section{Projection on horizontal scales}

To better understand the projection of these flows onto different horizontal
scales, we calculate wavenumber spectra of kinetic energy and sea-surface height
(SSH) variance. For simplicity we calculate zonal wavenumber spectra at various
latitudes. The two-year time averaged and spatial linear trend were
removed, and the ensuing fields were Hanning spectral ``window''. Statistical significance
is obtained by averaging over latitude and time. Using conservative temporal and
spatial decorrelation estimate of 10 days and 250 km, we obtain roughly 50
independent realizations of the spectra.

Figure \ref{fig3}a depicts the horizontal wavenumber spectra of surface KE in
April and October. At scales larger than 20km, the spectra based on hourly
velocity snapshots are nearly indistinguishable within 95$\%$ confidence level
(compare solid lines in figure \ref{fig3}a). Consistent with the results of
\citet{rocha_etal2016} who analyzed the LLC4320 output in Drake Passage,
there is significant high-frequency variabilty at submesoscales. Daily-averaging
the velocity field suppresses spatial variability at scales smaller than about 250
km both in April and October (compare solid lines against dashed lines in figure
\ref{fig3}a). But this suppression is more dramatic in October, when the horizontally
divergent flows peak. At scales
smaller than 100 km, 40$\%$ of the surface KE in April is accounted for by supra-inertial
flows as opposed to 77$\%$ in October. The seasonality of subinertial submesoscale flows
is significant, consistent with the results of \citet{sasaki_etal2014}, which are
based on snapshots of a model without tidal forcing.

These high-frequency submesoscale flows significantly project on the sea-surface.
In October, when the horizontally divergent flows peak and the submesoscale
balanced flows are minimum, there is a dramatic difference between the spectra
based on hourly and daily-averaged SSH: at scales smaller than 100 km, the spectra
of hourly SSH roughly follows a $-2$ power-law, whereas the spectra of daily-averaged
SSH roughly follows a $-5$ power-law. At scales
smaller than 100 km, 44$\%$ of the surface KE in April is accounted for by suprainertial
flows as opposed to 86$\%$ in October! The out-of-phase seasonal cycle of subinertial
and suprainertial flows conspire to yield nearly insignificant seasonality in the spectra
of hourly SSH.

% Here we argue that those divergent motions are likely inertia-gravity waves.
% We can show a couple of spectra and argue that they roughly satisfy polarization
% relations.
%
% We can also try and show some observations here. Any cruises with ADCP data.
% While it may be hard to have enough data for the errorbars to be small, a
% rough consistency may be better than nothing.
%
% Perhaps a mooring data should show strong seasonal modulation at high-frequencies?
%
% We must be able to present some observational evidence that the model is not
% misleading at high-frequencies.


% Here we argue that high-frequency (supra-daily) flows significantly project
% on the sea-surface, and thus estimation of submesoscale (10-100 km) geostrophic
% velocity from sea-surface height (SSH) is not warranted. Calculating spectral
% KE fluxes from both velocity and geostrophic velocity (from SSH) would
% contrast with the results in Sasaki et al.

 \end{center}
\end{figure*}

\section{Projection on time scales}
To better understand the high-frequency/high-wavenumber flows  we calculate frequency
spectra of surface KE (figure \ref{fig4}). To obtain statistically meaningful results,
we average spectral estimates along a section at 165$^\circ$E.  There is about 50
independent spectral realizations.

The surface KE spectra of subinertial flows very roughly follow a $-2$ power-law.
The high-frequency flows are split near-inertial flows, tidal signals and their
higher harmonics. Hence these high-frequency flows are dominated by inertia-gravity
waves. (Note that the inertial peak nearly merges with the
diurnal tide peak.) There is statistically significant seasonality. The seasonal
cycle of the sub-inertial motions (at least for periods between 5-20 days)
is out-of-phase with the seasonal cycle of supra-inertial flows: the former flows
are more energetic in April and the latter in October.

Most of these high-frequency inertia-gravity waves project onto scales smaller
than 100 km. The surface KE spectra of 100-km-smoothed velocity field is significantly
suppressed in supra-inertial frequencies --- there are no statistically significant
changes at sub-inertial frequencies (see dashed lines in figure \ref{fig4}).

\section{Summary and Discussion}
Our main finding is that
upper-ocean divergent flows, dominated by inertia-gravity waves, undergo
a strong seasonal cycle that is out-of-phase with the seasonal cycle of
the quasi-balanced flows. Therefore, the present results suggest significant
seasonal modulation of the dominant upper-ocean dynamics at submesoscales
(10-100 km): quasi-balanced turbulence driven by shallow baroclinic instabilities
in late Winter/early Spring
and inertia-gravity waves dominate in late Summer/early Fall.

That the  surface velocity and SSH submesoscale variability may be
dominated by ageostrophic flows in
Summer/Fall has consequences for the interpretation of data from
the future SWOT and COMPIRA altimeter missions,
which will deliver SSH measurements at submesoscales. To the extent that
high-frequency flows are dominated by spatially incoherent internal tides and other
internal waves, it may be very difficult (if not impossible) to
separate SSH submesoscale variability associated with geostrophic motions
from high-frequency, ageostrophic flows. Thus, previous claims that
one will be able to easily obtain submesoscale surface
geostrophic velocities and monitor such seasonal cycle on global scales
\citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014} are overstated.

The present analysis focuses on a single patch of ocean in the
vicinities of the Kuroshio Extension, not
representative of other regions such as eastern boundary currents
and the middle of the subtropical gyre: care must be taken in overgeneralizing
these results.  The effects of smaller-scale/higher-frequency
``sub-submesoscale'' flows on the submesoscale surface velocity and SSH variability
are presently unknown.

 LLC hierarchy setup
and control files are available online
(at \texttt{http://mitgcm.org/viewvc/MITgcm/MITgcm$\_$contrib/

using a linearized equation. While the nominal horizontal resolution  of the
LLC2160 simulation is 1/24$^\circ$,
 horizontal wavenumber spectra suggests an effective resolution of about 20 km.
 (see figure \ref{fig3}).

\subsection{How well does the model captures high-frequency modes?}
To assess how well the LLC2160 represents the high-frequency variability,
we compare the model near-surface velocity field against two available
mooring data: KEO (the data is available online at \texttt{http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/ocs/KEO})
and KESS mooring $\#$7 (the data is available online at \texttt{http://uskess.whoi.edu}).
For proper comparison, we use model data closest to these two moorings (west of
the region considered in the present study). Focusing on high-frequencies, we
calculate frequency spectral estimates every month. There are about 48 independent
spectral realizations.

Figure \ref{figA1} shows KE frequency spectra for the model and mooring data.
At the uppermost common depth (20 m), very low frequencies (periods > 10 days)
and the inertial, diurnal, and semi-diurnal frequencies agree well --- the KESS
data are more energetic at intermedia frequencies. At 40 m, the model and observations
have consistent spectra at periods larger than about 6 h. The data from moorings
are more energetic at higher frequencies and tidal harmonics are not observed,
except for the first two harmonics that are apparent in the KESS data at 40 m.
Three reasons for the lack of tidal harmonics in the mooring data are: 1) The high-
frequency variability is dominated by high-frequency noise due to mooring vertical
excursions; 2) The model does not have enough resolution to resolve the full spectrum
of ultraviolet catastrophic wave-wave interactions; 3) The model is not forced at
frequencies higher that 6h.

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.
