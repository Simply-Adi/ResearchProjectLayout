\section{Introduction}

Recent interest in upper-ocean dynamics has focused on the strong seasonal
cycle of shallow baroclinic instabilities and their role in submesoscale (roughly 1-100 km)
turbulence and mesoscale modulation \citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014,
callies_etal2015, thompson_etal2016,buckingham_etal2016}. Contemporary studies
have also suggested that inertia-gravity waves contribute significantly
to the near-surface variability at submesoscales \citep{richman_etal2012,
buhler_etal2014,rocha_etal2016}, but their seasonality has not been investigated.

Using the output of two $1/24^\circ$ and $1/48^\circ$ global
numerical simulations with embedded tides, we show that inertia-gravity waves undergo
a strong seasonality near the surface in the Kuroshio Extension region.
Interestingly, the seasonal cycle of inertia-gravity waves is out-of-phase
with the seasonal cycle of submesoscale turbulence. Consistent with previous studies,
deep late Winter mixed layers are prone to
shallow baroclinic instabilities that are roughly in geostrophic balance
and flux energy upscale \citep{sasaki_etal2014,callies_etal2016},
driving a mild seasonal modulation of the mesoscales \citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014}.

Inertia-gravity waves, on the other hand, peak in late Summer/early Fall,
when the upper ocean is strongly stratified. Thus there exists a
strong seasonal modulation in the dominant upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics:
submesoscale turbulence dominates the upper-ocean dynamics in late Winter/early Spring,
whereas quasi-linear inertia-gravity waves prevail in late Summer/early Fall.
Because submesoscale turbulence is weakest in late Summer/early Fall,
the present results suggest that inertia-gravity waves account for most of the
summertime submesoscale SSH variability.

\section{The LLC numerical simulations}
We use the output of two latitude-longitude polar cap (LLC)
realistic numerical simulations. The outputs
analyzed here, LLC2160 (1/24$^\circ$) and LLC4320 (1/48$^\circ$),   are
forward Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm)
numerical solutions on a LLC grid  \citep{forget_etal2015} with
90-vertical-levels. The coarser-resolution LLC simulation was
spun up from a ECCO2 adjoint-method state estimate, which synthetized millions
of observations from 2009 through 2011. Both simulations were forced by
tides and 6-hourly surface fluxes. The LLC2160
output spans two years from March 2011 to April 2013; the LLC4320 was spun up from
the LLC2160 simulation, spanning one year from September 2011 to September 2012.
The LLC4320 simulation is an extension of the 5-month long output used by
\citet{rocha_etal2016}.

A key aspect of the LLC simulations is that they were forced by
the 16 most-significant tidal components.
Because barotropic tides interact with topography and generate internal
tides that project onto mesoscales to submesoscales
\citep[e.g., ][]{rocha_etal2016}, tidal forcing fundamentally distinguishes our analysis
from recent modeling studies that investigated upper-ocean dynamics
and its seasonality \citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014}. Details of the LLC simulations
are provided in the supplemental material.

To study seasonal variations in the upper-ocean dynamics, we focus on the northwest
Pacific, in the vicinity of the Kuroshio
Extension, where previous studies have suggested strong submesoscale seasonality
\citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014}.
We analyze a sub-domain of the LLC4320 and LLC2160 simulations of about 2000 km$^2$
spanning 155-175$^\circ$E; 25-40$^\circ$N (figure \ref{fig1}a). The stratification
in this mesoscale-rich subtropical region undergoes a vigorous seasonal cycle: wintertime-enhanced
small-scale turbulence de-stratifies the upper ocean, yielding mixed layers
as deep as 300m. In late Spring/early Summer enhanced solar radiation and mixed-layer
instabilities re-stratify the upper ocean, yielding mixed layers as shallow as 40m.
Fundamentally, the upper-ocean density structure is well-captured by both LLC simulations:
a comparison with Argo climatology shows that both simulations skillfully represent the Kuroshio
Extension stratification and its seasonal variability  (supplemental material).

 \end{figure*}

\section{Statistics of the surface lateral velocity tensor}
To study the seasonality in the surface velocity, we calculate the lateral velocity tensor
\begin{equation}
\nabla_h \bf{u}_h = \left[\begin{matrix} u_x & u_y\\ v_x&v_y \end{matrix}\right] \,.
\end{equation}
The components of the lateral velocity tensor are calculated using a centered
second-order finite difference scheme. We then diagnose
the vertical vorticity $\zeta \equiv v_x - u_y$, lateral rate of strain
$\alpha \equiv [(u_x-v_y)^2 + (u_y + v_x)^2]^{1/2}$, and horizontal divergence $\delta \equiv u_x + v_y$.
These diagnostics highlight the submesoscale structures in the flow
\citep[e.g.,][]{capet_etal2008a,shcherbina_etal2013}.

Figures \ref{fig1}b-c show snapshots of vertical vorticity $\zeta$ in early Spring
(April 15) and Fall (October 15) in the LLC4320 (1/48$^\circ$) simulation.
The model solutions depict seasonality in vorticity: large values of
fine-grained vertical vorticity are observed in early Spring with maximum
values as large as $4f$, where $f$ is
the local planetary vorticity, and root-mean-square (RMS) of about $0.4f$. In early
Fall, the situation is the opposite: the vertical vorticity is relatively coarse-grained,
its local maximum and RMS is smaller than $0.5f$.
Indeed, the seasonal cycle of vorticity and rate of strain are strong (figure~\ref{fig2}):
in both simulations, the RMS vorticity and strain are about twice as large in
late Winter/early Spring
than in late Summer/early Fall. Because the wintertime vorticity and strain rate
are dominated by the smallest scales in the flow (the KE spectra is shallower than
a $-3$ power-law in Winter), increasing the resolution from
1/24$^\circ$ to 1/48$^\circ$ significantly increases the wintertime RMS vorticity
and strain by about 40$\%$.

 \begin{figure*}[ht]
   \begin{center}
     \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{figs/fig2.pdf}
  \caption{Time series of the root-mean-square (RMS) of vorticity (a) and
  rate of strain (b), and horizontal divergence (c) in the LLC outputs and gridded AVISO data.}
  \label{fig2}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

The bulk of vertical vorticity and strain rate are associated with subinertial flows
($T_f = 2\pi/f_0\approx 23.5$h, where $f_0$ is the inertial frequency at
the mean latitude): daily-averaging the velocity fields suppresses superinertial
motions and reduces the RMS
vorticity by less than 40$\%$ and the RMS strain by less than 10$\%$; the seasonal
cycle remains strong (see
dashed lines in figures \ref{fig2}a-b). Most of this seasonal cycle is associated
with submesoscale flows: smoothing the velocity fields
with a Hanning filter with cut-off scale of 100 km dramatically reduces the RMS
vorticity and strain. The reduction in variance is about 80$\%$ in winter,
yielding RMS vorticity and strain roughly consistent with the diagnostics from
AVISO gridded geostrophic velocities (compare red lines to black lines in figures \ref{fig2}a-b).
The picture that emerges is consistent with recent studies: shallow baroclinic
instabilities energize the submesoscales in late Winter, drawing from the available
potential energy stored in deep mixed layers \citep{sasaki_etal2014,callies_etal2015,callies_etal2016}.

The seasonal cycle of the horizontal divergence, however, showcases the complexity
of the upper-ocean annual variability. If submesoscale eddies and fronts dominated
the near-surface variability all year, then the seasonal cycle of horizontal divergence,
vertical vorticity, and lateral strain rate would be in phase \citep[e.g.,][]{sasaki_etal2014}.
While there is a clear wintertime peak in divergence of daily-averaged velocity
(see dashed lines in figure \ref{fig2}c; RMS divergence $\sim0.22 f$ in the 1/48$^\circ$
simulation), the hourly fields show
a stronger enhancement of
lateral divergence in late Summer/early Fall (RMS divergence $\sim0.22 f$ the 1/48$^\circ$
simulation). Because the 1/48$^\circ$ simulation better resolves
smaller-scale submesoscale flows, a secondary RMS divergence peak in winter  is
nearly as strong as in Summer. Submesoscale fronts and eddies evolve
relatively fast, and there is no clear
temporal and spatial scale separation between those motions and inertia-gravity waves
\citep{mcwilliams2016}:
daily-averaging the velocity fields efficiently suppresses the summertime horizontally
divergent flows, but also reduces the wintertime lateral divergence by about 50$\%$.
The vorticity and strain rate (Figure \ref{fig2}a-b) show that most of the lateral divergence is associated
with submesoscale flows: smoothing the velocity fields with a 100km-cut-off
suppresses more than 80$\%$ of the RMS divergence.

\section{Seasonality in governing submesoscale dynamics}
The overall results of figure \ref{fig2}c suggest that submesoscale surface
 variability stems from different dynamics in Summer than Winter.
 To characterize these differences, we calculate
joint probability distributions (jPDF) of
vorticity-strain and vorticity-Laplacian of sea-surface height (\ref{fig3}).

The April vorticity-strain jPDF has a shape characteristic of submesoscale turbulence
 (see figures \ref{fig3}a-c). The alignment of vorticity and strain $\alpha \sim \pm\zeta$
 with strong positive skewness are fingerprints of submesoscale fronts
 \citep{shcherbina_etal2013,mcwilliams2016}. The shape of the vorticity-strain
 jPDF is similar for hourly, daily-averaged, and residual velocities, although
 the vorticity skewness reduces 1.4 to 1.13 from hourly to daily-averaged.
 Thus wintertime submesoscale surface velocity is strongly dominated by submesoscale turbulence --- this is true even for
 superinertial submesoscale currents. The hourly velocity fields are significantly
ageostrophic as depicted by the jPDF of vorticity-Laplacian of SSH
(figure \ref{fig3}g). While there is certainly much to be
learned using quasi-geostrophic models to study submesoscale turbulence, claims that
the submesoscale turbulence is dominantly in geostrophic balance
are overstated \citep{sasaki_etal2014,callies_etal2016}; only the daily-averaged fields
are largely
in  geostrophic balance (the jPDF of daily-averaged vorticity vs. Laplacian of SSH
is an ellipse with large eccentricity and main axis tilted by 45$^\circ$; figure \ref{fig3}h).

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1.\textwidth]{figs/fig3.pdf}
 \caption{Seasonal variation of joint probability distributions:  vorticity vs. strain rate (a through f).
          and vorticity vs. Laplacian of sea-surface height (g through l) in April (a through c;
          g  through i) and October (d through f;
          j  through l).
          Dashed lines in (a) through (e) represent pure strain flow $\alpha = \pm\zeta$,
          characteristic of fronts. Dashed lines in (f) through
          (l) represent geostrophic flow $\zeta = \frac{g}{f}\nabla_h^2 \eta$.}
 \label{fig3}
 \end{center}
\end{figure*}

The October vorticity-strain jPDF shows much weaker skewness (the vorticity skewness
is 0.68 and 0.67 for hourly and daily-averaged velocities). The shape of the
vorticity-strain jPDF  appears to be a combination of two half-ellipses centered
about $\zeta=0$, one with a 45$^\circ$ slope (characteristic of submesocale fronts
that persist in Summer) and one with a very steep slope.
That the submesoscale dynamics in October is mainly unbalanced is clearly depicted
in the shape of jPDF of vorticity-Laplacian of SSH for hourly and
residual fields
(figure \ref{fig3}j and \ref{fig3}k), which is an ellipse aligned in the vertical axis.
Of course daily-averaging the model suppresses the ageostrophic flows, and
the daily-averaged flow is essentially geostrophic as depicted by the 45$^\circ$-tilted
ellipse in the vorticity-Laplacian of SSH jPDF.

 Time series of vorticity and divergence PDFs (supplemental material) suggest
 a strong oscillation between these two regimes. In late Winter/early Spring
 the vorticity is strongly positively skewed, whereas the divergence is moderately
 negatively skewed as predicted by frontogenesis \citep{capet_etal2008a,mcwilliams2016}
. In late Summer/early Fall, the divergence is stronger, but PDFs are much less skewed,
consistent with linear inertia-gravity waves.

\section{Projection onto horizontal scales}

To better quantify the projection of these flows onto different horizontal
scales, we calculate wavenumber spectra of kinetic energy and sea-surface height
(SSH) variance.  Before calculating the spectra, time-mean and spatial linear
trends were removed, and the resulting fields were multiplied by a two-dimensional Hanning ``spectral window''.
The two-dimensional spectra were averaged azimuthly \citep[e.g., ][]{rocha_etal2016} .
We discuss only spectra for the 1/48$^\circ$, which extends the 1/24$^\circ$
towards smaller scales (supplemental material).



\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{figs/fig4.pdf}
 \caption{Surface (horizontal) KE (a) and SSH variance wavenumber spectra (b)
 in the 1/48$^\circ$ simulation. Solid lines
 are spectra based on hourly snapshots, dashed lines are spectra based on daily-averaged
 fields.}
 \label{fig4}
 \end{center}
\end{figure*}


Figure \ref{fig4}a depicts the horizontal wavenumber spectra of surface KE in
April and October. At scales larger than 20km, the spectra based on hourly
velocity snapshots are nearly indistinguishable within 95$\%$ confidence level
(compare solid lines in figure \ref{fig4}a). Consistent with the results of
\citet{rocha_etal2016} who analyzed a 5-month output of the LLC4320 simulation in Drake Passage,
there is significant high-frequency variabilty at submesoscales. Daily-averaging
the velocity field suppresses spatial variability at scales smaller than about 250
km both in April and October (compare solid lines against dashed lines in figure
\ref{fig4}a). But this suppression is dramatic in October, when the inertia-gravity waves peak. At scales
smaller than 100 km, 39$\%$ of the surface KE in April is accounted for by super-inertial
flows as opposed to 79$\%$ in October. The seasonality of subinertial submesoscale flows
is more dramatic than the seasonal cycle of the total flow. This is consistent
with the results of \citet{sasaki_etal2014}, which are
based on daily-averaged velocity fields of a different model without tidal forcing
(P. Klein, personal communication).

The inertia-gravity waves significantly project on the sea-surface.
In October, when the inertia-gravity waves are strongest the surface and submesoscale
turbulence is weakest. There is a dramatic difference between the spectra
based on hourly and daily-averaged SSH: at scales smaller than 100 km, the spectra
of hourly SSH roughly follows a $-2$ power-law, whereas the spectra of daily-averaged
SSH roughly follows a $-5$ power-law. At these scales, 33$\%$ of the SSH variance in April is accounted for by super-inertial
flows as opposed to 83$\%$ in October! Curiously, the out-of-phase seasonal cycle of submesoscale
turbulence and near-surface inertia-gravity waves conspire to yield very weak seasonality
in the spectra of KE and SSH variance based on hourly fields.


\section{Summary and Conclusion}
Our main finding is that in tidally forced global simulations the
near-surface upper-ocean inertia-gravity waves undergo
a strong seasonal cycle that is out-of-phase with the seasonal cycle of
submesoscale turbulence. \cite{dasaro1978} showed that velocity of linear internal waves
in the mixed-layer strongly depends on the density jump at the mixed-layer
base, with largest mixed layer velocities when the jump is strongest.
In Summer, the shallow mixed layer overlays a strong seasonal pycnocline,
and thus the internal waves projection onto the mixed-layer may be stronger
according to \cite{dasaro1978}'s arguments. An
alternative explanation is that the shape of the baroclinic modes
change seasonally. In particular the baroclinic modes are
significantly more surface intensified in late Summer/early Fall
 (supplemental material).
If the internal wave source has weak seasonal dependence, then a strong
seasonal cycle in the near-surface expression of internal waves is expected.
Internal tide generation does not show a seasonal modulation \citep[e.g.,][]{alford2003},
and therefore it is plausible to expect a strong seasonality in the near-surface
expression of internal tides and
other small-scale internal waves generated through internal tide interactions.
Near-inertial wave generation peaks in Winter, but those waves project on large
horizontal scales \citep[e.g, ][]{qi_etal1995}.

Our work adds to recent studies that presented modeling \cite{sasaki_etal2014}
and observational \citep{callies_etal2015,buckingham_etal2016} evidence of vigorous seasonality in
submesoscale turbulence. We conjecture that the summertime dominance of inertia-gravity waves
 \citep{callies_etal2015} is a consequence both of suppression of submesoscale turbulence and
enhancement of inertia-gravity waves due to re-stratification of
the upper ocean. Of course, our study focuses on a single patch of ocean in the
vicinity of the Kuroshio Extension, which may be typical of mesoscale-rich
subtropical regions, but is unlikely to be
representative of other regions such as low eddy kinetic energy eastern boundary currents
and the middle of the subtropical gyre; care must be taken to avoid overgeneralizing
these results.  We plan to report on the geographic variability of submesoscale
 seasonality in a future study.

%The effects of smaller-scale/higher-frequency
%``sub-submesoscale'' flows on the submesoscale surface velocity and SSH variability
%are presently unknown.

% That the  surface velocity and SSH submesoscale variability may be

% Summer/Fall has consequences for the interpretation of data from

% \citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014} are overstated.




% Here we argue that those divergent motions are likely inertia-gravity waves.

%
% We can also try and show some observations here. Any cruises with ADCP data.

%
% Perhaps a mooring data should show strong seasonal modulation at high-frequencies?
%

% Here we argue that high-frequency (supra-daily) flows significantly project

% contrast with the results in Sasaki et al.

% \section{Projection on time scales}
% To better understand the high-frequency/high-wavenumber flows  we calculate frequency
% spectra of surface KE (figure \ref{fig4}). To obtain statistically meaningful results,
% we average spectral estimates along a section at 165$^\circ$E.  There is about 50
% independent spectral realizations.
%
% The surface KE spectra of subinertial flows very roughly follow a $-2$ power-law.
% The high-frequency flows are split near-inertial flows, tidal signals and their
% higher harmonics. Hence these high-frequency flows are dominated by inertia-gravity
% waves. (Note that the inertial peak nearly merges with the
% diurnal tide peak.) There is statistically significant seasonality. The seasonal
% cycle of the sub-inertial motions (at least for periods between 5-20 days)
% is out-of-phase with the seasonal cycle of supra-inertial flows: the former flows
% are more energetic in April and the latter in October.
%
% Most of these high-frequency inertia-gravity waves project onto scales smaller
% than 100 km. The surface KE spectra of 100-km-smoothed velocity field is significantly
% suppressed in supra-inertial frequencies --- there are no statistically significant
% changes at sub-inertial frequencies (see dashed lines in figure \ref{fig4}).

% say something about relative energy in smoother vs. unsmoothed fields.
% also say something about comparison with observations.

\section*{Supplemental material 1: On the LLC simulations}

Table \ref{tab:llc} show details of the LLC spin-up hierarchy.
Both simulation analyzed in the present paper, LLC2160 and LLC4320,
were forced by surface fluxes are from the 0.14$^\circ$ European Centre for
Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) atmospheric operational model analysis,
 starting 2011 and the 16 most significant  tidal components.
The LLC control files are available online
(at \texttt{http://mitgcm.org/viewvc/MITgcm/MITgcm$\_$contrib/
llc$\_$hires}).

For the LLC hierarchy, the sea-surface height is calculated
using a linearized equation. While the nominal horizontal resolution  of the
LLC4320 simulation is 1/48$^\circ$,
horizontal wavenumber spectra suggests an effective resolution of about 8 km.
(see figure \ref{fig4}), and wavenumber spectra suggests an effective resolution
of 20 km for  LLC2160 simulation.

\subsection*{Spectra}
Kinetic energy and sea-surface height variance wavenumber spectra for the LLC2160
and LLC4320 simulations are shown in figure \ref{figS2_3}. As expected, and
consistent with the submesoscale regional study by \cite{capet_etal2008a}, the
higher-resolution simulation (LLC4320) essentially extends the spectra of the
lower-resolution simulation (LLC2160) towards smaller scale, demonstrating that
the higher resolution is resolving a wider array of scales. Between 20 and 100 km
there is linewidth agreement between the spectra of the two simulations.

\subsection*{Seasonality in the upper-ocean stratification}

Figure \ref{figS2_1} shows a comparison between potential density sections
at 165$^\circ$E from
the Roemmich-Gilson Argo Climatology \citep[updated from][]{roemmich_gilson2009}.
and the LLC2160 and LLC4320 simulations. Of course, the Argo climatology is smoother
owing to lower resolution and long-term averaging. Nonetheless, simulations reproduce well the strong
seasonality in the stratification. The upper ocean is weakly stratified in late Winter/early Fall
and restratifies in Summer. Argo climatology and LLC simulations mixed-layer depths are consistent
at all seasons (not shown).

          figures once extraction (currently down) becomes available}.}
  \label{figS2_1}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsection*{How well do the LLC simulations capture high-frequency modes?}
To assess how well the LLC simulations represents the high-frequency variability,
we compare the model near-surface velocity field against two available
mooring data: KEO (the data is available online at \texttt{http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/ocs/KEO})
and KESS mooring $\#$7 (the data is available online at \texttt{http://uskess.whoi.edu}).
For proper comparison, we use model data closest to these two moorings (west of
the region considered in the present study). Focusing on high-frequencies, we
calculate frequency spectral estimates every month. There are about 48 independent
spectral realizations.

Figure \ref{figA1} shows KE frequency spectra for the LLC simulations and mooring data.
At the uppermost common depth (20 m), very low frequencies (periods $>$ 10 days)
and the inertial, diurnal, and semi-diurnal frequencies agree well --- the KESS
data are more energetic at intermediate frequencies. At 40 m, the LLC simulations and observations
have consistent spectra at periods larger than about 6 h. The data from the moorings
are more energetic at higher frequencies,
except for the first two harmonics that are apparent in the KESS data at 40 m.
There are at least three reasons for the slightly more energetic super-inertial
variability in the observations: 1) The high-
frequency variability is dominated by high-frequency noise due to mooring vertical
excursions; 2) The model does not have enough resolution to resolve the full internal
wave spectrum; 3) The model is not forced at frequencies higher than 6h.

\section*{Supplemental material 3: Seasonality in pressure modes near-surface amplitude}

Figure \ref{figS3}a shows the domain-averaged potential density from the WOA 2013
climatology in April and October. Clearly, the changes to the stratification
are dramatic, with the formation of a seasonal pycnocline in Summer. The strong
seasonality of upper-ocean stratification yields a strong seasonality in the
near-surface shape and amplitude of baroclinic pressure modes (\ref{figS3}b).
In particular, the surface amplitude is much large in Summer. Thus the projection
of baroclinic tides on the surface may vary significantly seasonally.

\textcolor{red}{Perhaps include analytical results from a model with a slab over a slowly varying
pycnocline.}
