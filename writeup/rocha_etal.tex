\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
Recent studies have suggested that submesoscale upper-ocean flows
undergo strong seasonal cycle \citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014,
callies_etal2015, thompson_etal2016,buckingham_etal2016}.

Observations at submesoscales are limited.

SWOT and COMPIRA will provide submesoscale-resolving SSH measurements
with global coverage.



\subsection{This paper}
Using the output of a $1/24^\circ$ state estimate, we show that (vertical)
vorticity and (horizontal) divergence undergo strong seasonal cycle that are
out of phase. This seasonal cycle is associated with changes in the upper-ocean
stratification. As previously argued, in late Winter/early Spring,
deep mixed-layers are prone to
shallow baroclinic instabilities that are roughly in geostrophic balance
and flux energy upscale \citep{sasaki_etal2014,callies_etal2016},
driving a mild seasonal modulation at mesoscales \citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014}.
The divergence part of the flow, however, peaks in late Summer/early Fall,
when the upper-ocean is strongly stratified. Hence these results suggest a
strong seasonal modulation of the dominant upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics
with the dominance quasi-balanced turbulence in late Winter/early Spring and
quasi-linear inertia-gravity waves in late Summer/early Fall.

\section{The LLC2160 model output}
We use the output of the latitude-longitude polar cap (LLC)
MITgcm  numerical simulation. The output analyzed here, the LLC2160,
is the 1/24$^\circ$ --- 90-vertical-levels simulation from a hierarchy of global
forward numerical solutions on a LLC grid \citep{forget_etal2015} that were
spun up from a ECCO2 adjoint-method state estimate. The LLC2160 was forced by
tides and high-resolution surface fluxes similarly to the LLC4320 simulation
used by \citet{rocha_etal2016} --- see their appendix D. We chose the second-higher
resolution  simulation (LLC2160) of the LLC hierarchy because it was run for longer:
the LLC2160 output spans two years form March 2011 to April 2013. The model time-step
was 45 s and the model variables were saved hourly. LLC hierarchy model setup
and control files are available online
(at \texttt{http://mitgcm.org/viewvc/MITgcm/MITgcm$\_$contrib/
llc$\_$hires}). The model output was provided by D. Menemenlis (JPL/NASA).

 \caption{Surface (horizontal) KE frequency spectra. Solid lines

 \label{fig4}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The high-frequency signal}
Here we argue that those divergent motions are likely inertia-gravity waves.
We can show a couple of spectra and argue that they roughly satisfy polarization
relations.

We can also try and show some observations here. Any cruises with ADCP data.
While it may be hard to have enough data for the errorbars to be small, a
rough consistency may be better than nothing.

Perhaps a mooring data should show strong seasonal modulation at high-frequencies?

We must be able to present some observational evidence that the model is not
misleading at high-frequencies.

\subsection{Geostrophic velocities from SSH}
Here we argue that high-frequency (supra-daily) flows significantly project
on the sea-surface, and thus estimation of submesoscale (10-100 km) geostrophic
velocity from sea-surface height (SSH) is not warranted. Calculating spectral
KE fluxes from both velocity and geostrophic velocity (from SSH) would
contrast with the results in Sasaki et al.

\section{Summary and Discussion}
Our main finding is that
upper-ocean divergent flows, dominated by inertia-gravity waves, undergo
a strong seasonal cycle that is out-of-phase with the seasonal cycle of
the quasi-balanced flows. Therefore, the present results suggest significant
seasonal modulation of the dominant upper-ocean dynamics at submesoscales
(10-100 km): Quasi-balanced turbulence driven by shallow baroclinic instabilities
 in late Winter/early Spring
and inertia-gravity waves dominate in late Summer/early Fall.

That the surface velocity and SSH submesoscale (10-100 km) variability may be
dominated by ageostrophic flows in
Summer/Fall has consequences for the interpretation of data from
the future SWOT and COMPIRA altimeter missions,
which will deliver SSH measurements at submesoscales. To the extent that
high-frequency flows are dominated by incoherent internal tides and other
internal waves, it may be very difficult (if not impossible) to
separate submesoscale SSH variability associated with geostrophic motions
from high-frequency, ageostrophic flows. Thus, previous claims that
one will be able to easily obtain submesoscale surface
geostrophic velocities and monitor such seasonal cycle on global scales
\citep{sasaki_etal2014,qiu_etal2014} are overstated.

The present analysis focuses on a single patch of ocean in the
vicinities of the Kuroshio Extension, not
representative of other regions such as eastern boundary currents
and the middle of the subtropical gyre: care must be taken in overgeneralizing
these results with care.  The effects of smaller-scale/higher-frequency
``sub-submesoscale'' flows on the submesoscale surface velocity and SSH variability
are presently unknown.
