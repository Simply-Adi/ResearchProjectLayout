Key Points
----------

  - Upper-ocean submesoscale (10-100 km) turbulence and inertia-gravity waves undergo strong seasonal cycles that are out of phase.
  - Submesoscale turbulence dominates the horizontal velocity and sea-surface height variability in late winter/early spring.
  - Submesoscale inertia-gravity waves dominate the horizontal velocity and sea-surface height variability in late summer/early fall.
